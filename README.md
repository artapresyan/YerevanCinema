# YerevanCinema

The purpose of my website is to make the purchase of tickets easier. Thanks to this website,
they can choose which session they want to get, see the price, in which hall it will be screened etc.
Unauthenticated users have no many privileges, they can visit website view some sessions with no ability to use filters,
they can't also purchase tickets.
Authenticated users have a lot of privileges such as filters(search by movie, price, category, hall),
purchase tickets online anytime and anywhere, get tickets via registered email etc.
Employees can register as customers and get admin permissions at the head office in 2-3 days,
or visit the head office and register as an admin.
